# Try To Explain...
_I like to try to explain the concepts I learn to myself. This allows me to check if I have fully grasped all the notions that encompass the concept or if some are still lacking. This repository gathers all the topics I have tried to explain in simple terms. Initially useful to myself, it is completely public to be helpful to anyone who finds aid in the information it contains._
